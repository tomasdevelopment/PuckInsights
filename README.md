# PuckInsights
PuckInsights uses data found online on NHL and Ice hockey and does a exploratory data analysis of it, initially using a google notebooks and once the project is completed I will modify the code converting it into  azure container apps project to deploy it  in cloud. 


I used DF containing the followoing information after cleaning, to do a data exploratory and practical statistical analysis of it:
