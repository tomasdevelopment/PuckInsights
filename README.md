# PuckInsights
PuckInsights uses data found online on NHL and Ice hockey and does a exploratory data analysis of it, using azure functions to deploy it. 


I used DF containing the followoing information after cleaning, to do a data exploratory and practical statistical analysis of it:

           cols: 23
      memory_MB: 5.67
  bytes_per_row: 485.3
       min_year: 1963
       max_year: 2022
