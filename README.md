# PuckInsights
PuckInsights uses data found online on NHL and Ice hockey and does a exploratory data analysis of it, initially using a google notebooks and once the project is completed I will modify the code converting it into  azure container apps project to deploy it  in cloud. It will be deployed through a series of articles in medium from the analysis to the infrastructure. The first one was about central tendencies and and dispertion statistics, then we'll deep dive into corelation, regresion and distribution models and finally deploy the dockerized mode.l. 


I used DF containing the followoing information after cleaning, to do a data exploratory and practical statistical analysis of it: 
 rows: 12250
           cols: 23
      memory_MB: 5.67
  bytes_per_row: 485.3
       min_year: 1963
       max_year: 2022
